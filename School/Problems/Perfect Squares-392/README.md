Some programs to solve a school problem
</h1>
</div>

A handful of programs based off of [this](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/resources/potw/2020-21/English/POTWD-20-N-25-S.pdf) problem I got in school.

[Iterate](https://github.com/28add11/RandomCollection/tree/main/School/Problems/Perfect%20Squares-392/Iterate) is the "Check every number" approach.

[Sensible]() is the approach in the problem's pdf.
